This specialized printer was designed exclusively for producing sterile 3D prints intended for use as implants in medical procedures. It operates within a controlled chamber environment where the internal temperature is maintained at 120 degrees Celsius to facilitate PEEK printing. Additionally, I conducted a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the printer to optimize and maintain laminar airflow within the chamber.",

      "In this project, we began by creating 3D STL files from 3D MRI scans of patients with skull defects, which were provided by medical professionals. We then proceeded to design patient-specific implants that could be manufactured through 3D printing using materials like PEEK or CNC milling using materials such as TI6Al4V. Subsequently, we conducted stress and failure analysis on these implants, utilizing the data obtained to optimize their shape and weight for better performance and patient outcomes.",

    projectDetails:
      "This project was developed to assist individuals experiencing difficulties in moving their body parts or those with paralysis. It was integrated into a wheelchair system and operated by monitoring the movement of the patient's eyes, specifically their iris, in response to user input. Two software platforms, Python and MATLAB, played crucial roles in this project. In MATLAB, we implemented a Haar cascade classifier to detect the iris and determine the direction, while in Python, we utilized the widely-used Tensorflow framework to classify and translate the user's eye movements into wheelchair commands. Additionally, the wheelchair also served the important function of monitoring the patient's health through sensors like BCG (Ballistocardiography) and SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation).",

My responsibilities included calculating the motor and battery specifications, as well as determining the optimal speed to secure victories in various events. To adapt to different competitions, we employed two different gear ratios. Additionally, I designed a custom copper heatsink and duct system to efficiently cool down the motor during races.
